Use case on deep learning classification of cast products
Casting Process: 
Casting is one of the major manufacturing process in which molten metal is poured in to a cavity called mould and
allowed to cool till it gets solidified into product.
Casting defects: 
These are the defects in the cast product occurred during the casting process and they are undesirable.
There are many types of defect in casting like blow hole, pin hole, burr, shrinkage defects, mould material defects, 
pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects etc.Casting defects are undesirable and cause loss to the manufacturer, 
therefore the quality department have to do visual inspection of the products and separate the defective one from the good castings. 
The visual inspection is labour intensive and time consuming, therefore In this project Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) is used to automate 
this process of image classification by developing an GUI based "CASTING INSPECTOR" app.
